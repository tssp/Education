We expect a folder named "UCI HAR Dataset" within the script directory. Within 
this folder there must be subfolders of names "test" and "train".

The "train" folder must have 3 files:

* X_train.txt -> Training set
* y_train.txt -> Training labels
* subject_train.txt -> Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30

And the "test" folder:
* X_test.txt -> Training set
* y_test.txt -> Training labels
* subject_test.txt -> Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
