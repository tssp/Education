This repository contains scripts that create a tidy data out of the raw data. The raw data is a collection of observations about *Wearable Computing*.

The file CodeBook.md contains information about the variables, the transformations that have been made to the raw data and how to use the transformation script run_analysis.R .

The run_analysis.R file contains the R instructions to perform the transformations on the data set and saves the final results.
